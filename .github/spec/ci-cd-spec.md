# OSIRIS CI/CD Specification

## Overview
This specification defines the continuous integration and deployment workflow for OSIRIS, the Platform for All-Domain Anomaly Tracking. The workflow implements automated testing, issue tracking, pull request management, and documentation updates.

## Objectives
1. Automate testing across all branches
2. Provide immediate feedback on test failures
3. Streamline the merge process for successful changes
4. Maintain up-to-date documentation
5. Publish test results for transparency

## Workflow Components

### 1. Branch-Specific Testing
**Purpose**: Execute appropriate test suites based on branch type and purpose.

**Triggers**:
- Push events to main, develop, feature/*, bugfix/* branches
- Pull request events targeting main or develop
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Test Suites by Branch**:
- `main`: Full production suite (unit, integration, e2e, performance, security)
- `develop`: Development suite (unit, integration, API tests)
- `feature/*`: Feature-specific suite (unit, feature tests)
- `bugfix/*`: Bugfix validation suite (unit, regression tests)

**Outputs**:
- Test result status (success/failure)
- Test summary report
- Timestamped test artifacts

### 2. Issue Creation for Test Failures
**Purpose**: Automatically track test failures with GitHub issues.

**Behavior**:
- Triggers only when tests fail
- Creates issue with detailed failure information
- Includes: branch name, commit SHA, workflow run link
- Auto-labels with 'test-failure' and 'automated'

**Issue Content**:
- Test failure summary
- Link to workflow run
- Action items for resolution

### 3. Auto-PR Creation for Successful Branches
**Purpose**: Streamline merge process for branches with passing tests.

**Behavior**:
- Triggers on successful test completion
- Only for feature/* and bugfix/* branches
- Skips if PR already exists
- Targets develop branch by default

**PR Content**:
- Success notification
- Test results summary
- Links to workflow evidence
- Merge recommendations

### 4. README Updates with Test Summaries
**Purpose**: Keep repository documentation current with latest test results.

**Behavior**:
- Triggers on main and develop branches
- Updates "Latest Test Results" section
- Includes timestamp and test status
- Commits changes automatically with [skip ci]

**Information Included**:
- Branch name
- Commit SHA
- Test status
- Timestamp
- Summary details

### 5. GitHub Pages Deployment
**Purpose**: Publish test results dashboard publicly.

**Behavior**:
- Triggers only on main branch
- Creates/updates GitHub Pages site
- Deploys test results dashboard

**Dashboard Features**:
- Visual test status display
- Latest results from main branch
- Links to workflow runs
- Repository information

## Technical Specifications

### Permissions Required
- `contents: write` - For README updates and repository access
- `issues: write` - For creating test failure issues
- `pull-requests: write` - For creating auto-PRs
- `pages: write` - For GitHub Pages deployment
- `id-token: write` - For Pages authentication

### Environment Requirements
- Ubuntu latest runner
- GitHub Actions v4 checkout
- GitHub Script v7 for API interactions
- Pages deployment actions v3/v4

### Artifacts
- Test results stored as workflow artifacts
- Artifact naming: `test-results-{branch}-{run-number}`
- Retention follows repository settings

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Tests execute automatically on all specified branches
- ✅ Failed tests generate trackable issues
- ✅ Successful branches trigger PR creation
- ✅ README stays current with test results
- ✅ GitHub Pages publishes test dashboard

## Maintenance Notes
- Workflow follows Spec-Kit conventions
- Uses descriptive naming for clarity
- Implements proper error handling
- Includes comprehensive logging
- Supports manual triggering for testing

## Version
- **Specification Version**: 1.0.0
- **Last Updated**: 2025-10-24
