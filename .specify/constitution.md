# OSIRIS Constitution

## Purpose

OSIRIS (Orbital, Spatial, and Integrated Reconnaissance Intelligence System) is a self-updating, AI-driven platform for multi-domain anomaly detection. It fuses data from orbital, atmospheric, and terrestrial sources to identify patterns and anomalies across all domains.

## Principles

### 1. Multi-Domain Integration

All domains (orbital, atmospheric, terrestrial) are treated as equal contributors to the unified intelligence picture. No single domain takes precedence.

### 2. AI-First Architecture

Machine learning and AI models drive detection, classification, and correlation. Human oversight validates and refines the system's understanding.

### 3. Self-Updating System

The platform autonomously ingests new data, updates models, and evolves its detection capabilities through continuous learning.

### 4. Serverless and Modular

Each component is independently deployable, scalable, and maintainable. Services communicate through well-defined interfaces.

### 5. Specification-Driven Development

All development begins with clear specifications following the Spec-Kit framework. Code implements specifications, not vice versa.

### 6. Automation First

Manual processes are minimized. CI/CD pipelines handle testing, deployment, and verification automatically.

### 7. Transparent Operations

The README serves as a live status page, always reflecting the current state of the system and linking to detailed metrics.

## Architecture Principles

### Modularity

- Each data source (orbital, atmospheric, terrestrial) has its own module
- Data fusion operates independently
- Anomaly detection is pluggable and extensible
- Modules communicate via standardized APIs

### Scalability

- Serverless functions scale automatically with load
- State is externalized to managed services
- Processing is parallelizable across data domains

### Reliability

- Each module has comprehensive error handling
- Failed operations are retried with exponential backoff
- Monitoring and alerting are built-in from day one

### Security

- All data in transit is encrypted
- API endpoints require authentication
- Secrets are managed through environment variables
- Regular security audits via automated scanning

## Data Domains

### Orbital Domain

- Satellite imagery and telemetry
- Orbital object tracking
- Space weather data
- RF emissions from space assets

### Atmospheric Domain

- Weather patterns and anomalies
- Air quality measurements
- Flight tracking and patterns
- Atmospheric composition data

### Terrestrial Domain

- Ground-based sensor networks
- Seismic activity
- Infrastructure monitoring
- Network traffic patterns

## Development Standards

### Code Quality

- All code must pass linting checks
- Minimum 80% test coverage for core modules
- Peer review required for all changes
- Security scanning on every commit

### Documentation

- Every module has comprehensive README
- API documentation is auto-generated from code
- Architecture decisions are recorded (ADRs)
- Status updates are automated

### Testing

- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for module interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical paths
- Performance benchmarks for data processing

### Deployment

- Feature branches tested before merge
- Automated promotion through dev → test → stage → prod
- Rollback capability for all deployments
- Zero-downtime deployments required

## Governance

### Change Management

- Constitution changes require explicit review
- Spec changes documented as ADRs
- Breaking API changes require deprecation period
- Major architectural changes need team consensus

### Quality Gates

- All tests must pass before merge
- Security scans must show no critical issues
- Performance must not regress
- Documentation must be updated

### Continuous Improvement

- Regular retrospectives on process
- Performance metrics reviewed weekly
- Security audits performed monthly
- Architecture reviews performed quarterly

## Success Metrics

- **Detection Accuracy**: >95% for known anomaly types
- **False Positive Rate**: <5% across all domains
- **Processing Latency**: <1 minute from data ingestion to analysis
- **Test Coverage**: >80% across all modules
- **Deployment Frequency**: Multiple times per day capability
- **Mean Time to Recovery**: <15 minutes for critical issues
