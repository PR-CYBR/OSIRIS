# OSIRIS Project Plan

## Project Overview

OSIRIS (Platform for All-Domain Anomaly Tracking) is a comprehensive system designed to track, analyze, and report anomalies across multiple domains including orbital, atmospheric, and terrestrial environments.

## Project Goals

1. **Multi-Domain Data Integration**: Aggregate and process data from various sources across different domains
2. **Intelligent Analysis**: Apply AI/ML techniques to identify patterns and anomalies
3. **Automated Operations**: Minimize manual intervention through intelligent automation
4. **Real-Time Visibility**: Provide up-to-date status and reporting capabilities

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Architecture
- Establish data ingestion pipelines for all domains
- Implement basic data validation and storage
- Set up foundational infrastructure

### Phase 2: AI Integration
- Develop and deploy AI fusion engine
- Implement pattern recognition algorithms
- Create anomaly detection models

### Phase 3: Automation
- Build auto-branch management system
- Implement automated workflow triggers
- Create self-healing capabilities

### Phase 4: Reporting & Visualization
- Develop status page generation pipeline
- Create dashboards and visualization tools
- Implement alerting mechanisms

## Technical Architecture

For detailed technical architecture and module specifications, see [spec.md](./spec.md).

## Key Milestones

1. **M1**: Data ingestion framework operational
2. **M2**: AI fusion engine processing first datasets
3. **M3**: Auto-branch management system live
4. **M4**: Status page generation pipeline deployed
5. **M5**: Full system integration and testing complete

## Success Criteria

- Successfully ingest data from all three domains (orbital, atmospheric, terrestrial)
- AI fusion engine achieves target accuracy metrics
- Auto-branch management reduces manual intervention by 90%
- Status pages update in real-time with < 5 second latency
- System maintains 99.9% uptime

## Resources

- Development Team
- Data Sources (APIs, feeds, sensors)
- Computing Infrastructure
- AI/ML Models and Training Data

## Risks & Mitigation

1. **Data Quality**: Implement robust validation and cleaning processes
2. **Integration Complexity**: Use standardized interfaces and protocols
3. **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling from the start
4. **Security**: Apply defense-in-depth security principles
